## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jie Shen](https://sites.google.com/site/jieshensjtu/). Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of New South Wales. While there, I worked on AI for cybersecurity with [Dr. Jiaojiao Jiang](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/dr-jiaojiao-jiang) and large-scale optimization with [Prof. Guoyin Li](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~gyli/).
